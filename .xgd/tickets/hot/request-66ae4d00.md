## Goal

A **first-pass flexibility probe** for the framework: hand-pick ~18 small-business websites, reproduce each one through the existing capture → reproduce → eyes loop, and record where the framework falls short. This is the manual, scoped-down precursor to the [[REQ-18]] crawler + batch-coverage engine ([[DOC-15]]) — not thousands of sites, just enough breadth to find the important gaps in representing a simple Wix/WordPress/Squarespace site.

The output that matters is the **results table** at the bottom: for each site, a link to the original, a link to our reproduction, and a link to a per-site **report ticket** listing the observed differences and the framework changes that would close them.

## Approach — why these sites

The selection is **coverage-driven, not volume-driven**. Sites are chosen to spread across four axes so each one stresses a different part of the framework rather than repeating the same hero-over-image pattern:

- **Platform:** Wix · Squarespace · WordPress/Astra · Elementor · real-world / hand-built
- **Structure:** single-page (anchor-nav) vs multi-page (tabs/dropdown)
- **Vertical** (the [[DOC-4]] targets): caterer · consultant · coach · tradesperson · photographer · restaurant
- **Density/style:** minimal-whitespace vs image-heavy vs text-heavy

**Sourcing note ([[DOC-15]] §6):** the bulk are public template-gallery / theme-demo sites (meant to be viewed; the IP-safe path and the canonical shapes most real small-business sites are built from). **3 real live small-business sites** are included deliberately to surface the real-world grit a demo never has. Capture is transformative / internal capability-learning, not content redistribution.

⚠️ **URL verification:** Wix `view/html/<id>` and the confirmed Squarespace/Astra demo URLs are stable, direct capture targets. A few Squarespace/Astra demos follow a stable slug pattern (`<name>-fluid-demo.squarespace.com`, `websitedemos.net/<slug>/`) that must be **verified live at capture time** — flagged 🔎 below. Do not assume; confirm before capture.

## Site list

### Real sites (the "where's the meat" set)

## Per-site process

For each site, in order:
1. **Capture** — `1c capture page <url>` into the corpus (raw.html + screenshot + metadata). Transcribe from raw.html, not the screenshot (see [[faithful-repro-runbook]] / [[DOC-19]]).
2. **Reproduce** — build the site config with the current framework/module set.
3. **Eyes** — screenshot-diff reproduction vs original; note visual and structural deltas.
4. **Report ticket** — create one report ticket per site listing: (a) observed differences, (b) which are covered / generalizable / genuinely-new gaps, (c) proposed framework changes to close each gap (prefer generalizing an existing module — dial/variant/treatment — over a new module; see the module-generalization principle and [[REQ-32]]).
5. **Record** — add the row to the results table below.

## Results

_(Filled in as each site is reproduced.)_

| Original site | Our reproduction | Report ticket |
|---|---|---|
| _pending_ | | |

## Out of scope
- The [[REQ-18]] crawler, corpus-at-scale, and automated batch classifier (this ticket is the manual precursor).
- Customer-facing "build me a site like X" ([[DOC-15]] §7).
- IP/legal sign-off for at-scale public crawling.
